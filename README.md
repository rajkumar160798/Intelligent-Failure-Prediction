# Intelligent-Failure-Prediction
Machinery failures often originate from subtle, early-stage vibration changes. Detecting these early can prevent costly downtimes and ensure continuous operations. In this post, weâ€™ll simulate vibration signals and build an AI model using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks to detect failures in rotating equipment.
